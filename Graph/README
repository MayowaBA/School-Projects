THE Files being submitted are:

-README
-Makefile
-List.c
-List.h
-Graph.c
-Graph.h
-GraphTest.c
-FindPath.c

README is the table of contents.

The Makefile compiles, removes, checks, and submits
the files corresponding to the commands. This program
should work fine.

List.c this is an ADT that creates a List of Objects
that can be altered and manipulated with the cursor. 

List.h is the header file for the list ADT

Graph.c creates an array of Lists, stores the
adjacent vertices in each Node corresponding to the main vertex. 
Allowing access to each one by special access 
functions as well as manipulating them with manipulation functions.

Graph.h is the header file for the graph ADT

GraphTest.c this is a client file to test the 
minute capabilities of the Graph ADT.

FindPath.c this is another Client file for the graph ADT
that prints out the shortest distances and paths to certain 
source vertices.

This program prints out the same output as the example
in the pdf instructions and also passes all the tests.
