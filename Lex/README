THE Files being submitted are:

-README
-Makefile
-Lex.java
-List.java
-ListClient.java

README is the table of contents.

The Makefile compiles, removes, checks, and submits
the files corresponding to the commands. This program
should work fine.

Lex.java is a client file to test the the List ADT 
and also use it to arrange a String array in 
Lexicographical order using a method similar to 
insertion sort.

List.java this is an ADT that creates a List of Objects
that can be altered and manipulated with the cursor. 

ListClient.java this is client file give to test the 
minute capabilities of the List ADT.


This program prints out the same output as the example
in the pdf instructions and also passes all the tests.
