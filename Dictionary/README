THE Files being submitted are:

-README
-Makefile
-Dictionary.java
-DictionaryTest.java
-DuplicateKeyException.java
-KeyNotFoundException.java
-DictionaryInterface.java
-DictionaryClient.java

The Makefile compiles, removes, checks, and submits 
the files corresponding to the commands.This program
should work fine.


Dictionary.java makes a key and value dictionary using 
linked lists. It can edit the list by inserting, deleting
some or all the elements in each Node. It can also tell you
how many Nodes are present in the Dictionary.

DictionaryTest.java test the Dictionary.java program to try to
break the program in several ways.

DuplicateKeyException.java throws the duplicate key exception.

KeyNotFoundException.java throws the key not found exception.

DictionaryInterface.java has all the headers/prototypes for the
functions used in Dictionary.java

DictionaryClient.java is the code given to test Dictionary.java's 
capabilities.

README is the table of contents.


This program prints out the same output as the example
in the pdf instructions.
