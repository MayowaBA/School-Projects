THE Files being submitted are:

-README
-Makefile
-List.java
-ListTest.java
-Matrix.java
-MatrixTest.java
-Sparse.java

README is the table of contents.

The Makefile compiles, removes, checks, and submits
the files corresponding to the commands. This program
should work fine.

List.java this is an ADT that creates a List of Objects
that can be altered and manipulated with the cursor. 

ListTest.java this is client file used to test and
manipulate the capabilities of the List ADT.

Matrix.java creates a matrix in the form of a List
array of Entries. It contains certain functions
like multiplication, addition, subtraction, 
scalar Multiplication and a few more.

MatrixTest.java is the Client file to test Matrix,
making sure that all its various functionality are working 
to perfection.

Sparse.java is also another Client file that uses Matrix.
It showcases its various function by reading in input
from a file and saving the output in a new file.

This program prints out the same output as the example
in the pdf instructions and also passes all the tests.
