THE Files being submitted are:

-README
-Makefile
-Dictionary.c
-Dictionary.h
-DictionaryTest.c
-DictionaryClient.c

The Makefile compiles, removes, checks, and submits
the files corresponding to the commands.This program
should work fine.


Dictionary.c makes a key and value dictionary using
a hash table. It can edit the list by inserting, deleting
some or all the elements in each Node. It can also tell you
how many Nodes are present in the Dictionary.

DictionaryTest.c test the Dictionary.c program to try to
break the program in several ways.

Dictionary.h has all the headers/prototypes for the
functions used in Dictionary.c

DictionaryClient.c is the code given to test Dictionary.c's
capabilities.

README is the table of contents.


This program prints out the same output as the example
in the pdf instructions.
