THE Files being submitted are:

-README
-Makefile
-Dictionary.java
-DuplicateKeyException.java
-KeyNotFoundException.java
-DictionaryInterface.java
-DictionaryClient.java

The Makefile compiles, removes, checks, and submits 
the files corresponding to the commands.This program
should work fine.

Dictionary.java makes a key and value dictionary using 
a Binary Search Tree. It can edit the list by inserting, 
deleting some or all the elements in each Node. It can 
also tell you how many pairs are present in the Dictionary.

DuplicateKeyException.java throws the duplicate key exception.

KeyNotFoundException.java throws the key not found exception.

DictionaryInterface.java has all the headers/prototypes for the
functions used in Dictionary.java

DictionaryClient.java is the code given to test Dictionary.java's 
capabilities.

README is the table of contents.

This program prints out the same output as the example
in the pdf instructions.
